# Flags System Version 2

### V2 of the the flags system is a WIP!

The exact structure of the data files among other things may be changed at any time. Generally speaking V2 is aiming to be much more flexible than V1 along with adding some new features and merging separate systems into the flags system. Documentation on what each data file is used for will not be available for now at least.
