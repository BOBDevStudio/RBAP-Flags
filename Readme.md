This repository holds some files that are used by RBAP in a system inspired by Roblox's Fast Flags. `Main-Build.json` is the base file used in all versions of the game and other JSON files that names end with the word overwrite are for specific versions of the game. Each of the overwrite files are applied on top of the base file meaning if there there is a flag referenced in both files the value of the flag in the overwrite file will be used.

There is also some other files that are there for easy reading. They are called `Flags.md` and `Flags.csv` and both of which are automatically compiled by the bot when it makes commits. Those 2 files are virtually the same, the only difference being `Flags.md` takes advantage of markdown and `Flags.csv` just lists everything plainly in a table.

Similar files to `Flags.md` and `Flags.csv` also exist and the ones that end with `.json.md` and `.json.csv` are there for easy reading of a specific JSON file. Also it is worth noting that those files (the `.json.md` and `.json.csv` ones) are currently being compiled from the same data used to make `Flags.md` and `Flags.csv` so stuff like the `CommaAvoiderFlag` which may actually be in a file may not be listed. This will probably be changed in the future to have them be compiled from the data in the JSON file.
