This repository holds some files that are used by RBAP in a system inspired by Roblox's Fast Flags. `Main-Build.json` is the base file used in all versions of the game and other files that names end with the word overwrite are for specific versions of the game. Each of the overwrite files are applied on top of the base file meaning if there there is a key/flag referenced in both files the value in the overwrite file will be used.
