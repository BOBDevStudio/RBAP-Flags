### Key:

* `R` - Flag does not exist when that overwrite is used by the game. Useless when in used in a base value.
* `P` - The value of the flag is protected by the flags system in someway. This will only ever be listed in the base value column even if the protection is not in the main game.
* `U` - The flag is allowed to be live updated by the flags system.
